					<div class="col col-md-8">
						<p><strong>3.1 million</strong> children have been orphaned in Tanzania alone. Many of these children live in large households that struggle to provide care for all children.</p>
							
						<br>

						<p>Primary school is supposed to be free within Tanzania, but unfortunately this is not always true. Uniform fees, tuition fees, desk fees, and security fees can cost around 20,000 TSH, or about 10 USD.  With the average Orphaned or Vulnerable Children (OVC) household having 4 or more children, many caretakers cannot afford education.</p>

						<h1>Building A Better Organization</h1>

					<div class="col col-md-7">
						<p>The problem with a lot of organizations is when they come in to solve a problem, they get a grant from an outside person that funds them for a certain time.</p>
						
						<br>

						<p>But when that time is up, the money runs dry, and the program is forced to stop providing aid to the community</p>

						<br>

						<p>The organization then has to look for more money from a different person, which may want to try and solve a <em>different</em> problem—meaning families may be left back in the same situation as where they started.</p>

						<p>We plan to build community farms to allow caretakers of orphaned and vulnerable children the opportunity to sustainably fund their children’s education.</p>

						<br>

						<p>Produce grown from these farms will be sold in downtown Dar Es Salaam, with profits going straight to primary schools in which these children are enrolled.</p>
						
						<br>

						<p>Our funding creates farms, produce creates profit, which funds education and sustains the existing farms.</p>
